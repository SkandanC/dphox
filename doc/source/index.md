# DPhox

Yet another library for photonic design.

# At a glance

The `dphox` module is yet another Python 3-based design tool for automating photonic device development.

**Note**: This is a work in progress. Expect features in the code to be unstable until version `0.1.0`. Note the low
test coverage, which will be improved in coming weeks.

## [Documentation and tutorials](https://dphox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The [documentation](https://dphox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) contains the API reference for `dphox`
and the tutorials you need to get started.

We also provide a number of Colab tutorials to introduce the basics:
1. [**Photonic design**](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/sunilkpai/a74439194069bf9538ccc828c6227836/00_photonics.ipynb#scrollTo=25f87704-e435-4ff5-8b1c-3453ec30c330)
2. Fundamentals: the core classes `dp.Pattern` and `dp.Curve` and various transformations / examples.
3. Design workflow: concepts for designing a chip in an automated fabless workflow.
